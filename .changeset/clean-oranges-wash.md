Adds support to use the connectors with wagmi v1. 
Major version bump to support wagmi v1 ✌️

For migration: 
1. update the connector version to 1.0.0 
2. update Wagmi to v1 and install Viem (https://viem.sh) in place of ethers
3. follow migration guide https://wagmi.sh/react/migration-guide#1xx-breaking-changes to adapt your code to the new wagmi api.

Note: The connector itself has no API change.
